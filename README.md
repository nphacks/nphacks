I am a curious technologist blending software engineering, cybersecurity, AI, and business thinking into one evolving career.

I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Software Engineering from San Jose State University (2019), a Master’s in Project Management from Harrisburg University (2024), and I’m currently pursuing another Master’s in Computer Information Sciences with a Cybersecurity specialization (2026).

Professionally, I’ve worked on startup teams and held a software developer role at TCS (Citibank client) from 2022 to 2024. My stack includes Python, FastAPI, Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, Neo4j — with a strong interest in LLM-based applications and AI tools.

Lately, I’ve been throwing myself into AI-focused hackathons, trying to turn wild ideas into working demos. I care about solving real-world problems, building things that don’t exist yet, and combining business insight with tech innovation.

Even when I’m not on my job, I’m always a developer — learning, building, and experimenting.

**Tech never catches up to my ideas — but I’m working on that.**
